# map-and-app-gallery

The Local Government Maps and Apps Gallery is a configurable web application that provides citizens access to maps and apps you have developed for your local government and cataloged in ArcGIS.com. The maps and apps are organized into a gallery around information and services citizens need to do business with cities, counties, and other local governments. This application is typically deployed on-premises and is accessible from your local government's web site.

[Try the Maps and Apps Gallery application](http://localgovtemplates2.esri.com/MapsAndApps/)

[Detailed help](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/localgovernment/10.1/index.html#/What_is_Maps_and_Apps_Gallery/028s000000wq000000/)

### General Help
[New to Github? Get started here.](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/Esri/esri.github.com/blob/master/help/esri-getting-to-know-github.html)

Before running the Gallery, we recommend that you run checklist.html. This page duplicates many of the steps that the Gallery
does during its startup, but it provides diagnostic messages as it runs. It should complete and put a message at the top of the
page saying "Checklist testing is complete".

If you switch to a new gallery owner after having been running the Gallery, you may find that the Gallery does not change or
does not have any items. Clear your browser cache and run checklist.html. If the checklist.html fails at step 3.5 with the
message "No groups were found for...", then the proxy program has a cached authentication that needs to be cleared. Rename
proxy.config to anything else and re-run checklist.html; it will fail at step 3.3 with the message "Proxy configuration not
available; token cache cleared". Restore proxy.config's name and run the checklist again.
