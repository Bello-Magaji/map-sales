# map-and-app-gallery

The Local Government Maps and Apps Gallery is a configurable web application that provides citizens access to maps and apps you have developed for your local government and cataloged in ArcGIS.com. The maps and apps are organized into a gallery around information and services citizens need to do business with cities, counties, and other local governments. This application is typically deployed on-premises and is accessible from your local government’s web site.
